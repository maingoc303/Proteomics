# Proteomics
Project for the course Proteomics, applying Tandem Mass Spectrometry for protein sequencing
Pipeline for tha analysis is described as following:
1. Data from Tandem Mass Spectrometry are obtained and downloaded as zip file
2. Extract this dataset and run python code for the whole analysis
3. Python code will be excuted with:
    3.1 Reading files from folder extracted
    3.2 Creating database for protein and peptide
    3.3 Creating database for b and y ions based on peptides obtained from protein database
    3.4 Matching between the mass of tandem data and database will be counted
    3.5 Based on the count data, the protein sequence will be listed down and ranked and scored
4. Report for this pipeline analysis was written in pdf file.
